### Optimization Strategy

We offer **two types of optimization**:

#### 🎯 Audience Optimization (Every 14 Days)

Automatically improves your targeting based on:

- **Age & Gender**: Focus spending on segments that engage more.
- **Location**: Shift budget away from underperforming cities.
- **Placement**: Pause placements (e.g., Stories, Feed, In-stream) that don’t convert well.

> Example: If your smartwatch ad is converting well in New York for ages 18–35 via mobile feed, the system will automatically shift your focus there and reduce spend on segments like 60+ in Dallas via desktop.


#### 🎨 Creative Optimization (Every 7 Days)

Improves what users actually **see** in your ads:

- **Images & Videos**: Removes low-performing visuals.
- **Primary Text & Headlines**: Instead of removing, poorly performing copies are rewritten using AI for better engagement.
