### Dynamic Creative Ads

Dynamic creative ads automatically test different combinations of your ad elements (images, videos, headlines, text, CTAs, etc.) to find the best-performing combinations for each audience segment.

How it works:

-   You upload multiple images/videos, headlines, descriptions, etc.
-   Facebook mixes and matches these to create many variations.
-   The algorithm optimizes delivery to show the best combinations to each person.

**Example**

You upload:

-   3 images
-   2 headlines
-   2 descriptions

> → Facebook can create 3 x 2 x 2 = 12 ad variations and automatically test them.

**Benifits**

-   Saves time vs creating many individual ads
-   Better performance through automatic optimization
-   Personalized experience for different users

> **Use case**: Best for performance-focused campaigns (e.g., conversions, traffic, leads)

### Non-Dynamic Creative Ads

You create one static ad (or manually create multiple individual ads), where each version has fixed creative elements.

How it works:

-   You manually design each ad with one combination of image/video + text + CTA.
-   Facebook delivers that exact version to the audience without variation.

**Example**

You create Ad 1:

-   Image A + Headline A + Text A

Ad 2:

-   Image B + Headline B + Text B

> You have to manually test which ad performs better.

**Benifits**

-   Full control over how your ad appears
-   Useful when branding consistency is key
-   Better for storytelling or highly specific messaging

> **Use case**: Best for branding campaigns, awareness, or highly designed creatives
